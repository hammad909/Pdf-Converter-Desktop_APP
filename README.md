## Overview

**DocMorph** is a powerful **desktop application** designed to make document handling effortless.  
It allows users to **convert PDFs to other formats**, **convert files back to PDF**, **merge & split PDFs**, and **maintain a complete history of processed files** — all through a clean and intuitive interface.

What makes DocMorph unique is its **embedded local server**:
- The server **starts automatically** with the app  
- It remains **completely invisible** to the user  
- The app securely communicates with this server in the background

No setup. No configuration. Just smooth performance.

## How It Works

1. User launches the app  
2. The app **automatically starts its private local server**  
3. All file processing happens through this internal server

5. Every processed file is logged in the app’s history system
